Exercise for MSCH-C220

A basic space-shooter arcade game, created in Unity.

## Implementation

Created using [Unity 2022.3.62f1](https://unity.com).

Additional points:
- Self-made assets: Drew or procedurally generated all sprites used (+2)
- Particles: Created thruster particle systems and several particle-based explosions, including a self-drawn particle sprite sheet (+1)
- Screen-space shader: I used the URP shader graph to add pixelation and subtle bloom (+1)
- Visual damage: The player, asteroids, and enemies show damage taken in their sprites (+1)
